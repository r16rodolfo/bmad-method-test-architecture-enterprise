# TEA Command Reference

Quick reference for all 9 TEA (Test Engineering Architect) workflows. For detailed step-by-step guides, see the how-to documentation.

All workflows listed here are current and supported in TEA, including `nfr-assess`.

**Invocation by tool:**

- Claude Code / Cursor / Windsurf: use slash commands (for example, `/bmad:tea:automate`)
- Codex: use `$` skills from `.agents/skills` (for example, `$bmad-tea-testarch-automate`)
- Custom TEA extensions: package the workflow as custom content/module and attach it to `bmad-tea` via customization. See [Extend TEA with Custom Workflows](../how-to/customization/extend-tea-with-custom-workflows.md)

- Epic-level: Epic, stories, acceptance criteria

**Key Outputs:**

**System-Level (TWO Documents):**

- `test-design-architecture.md` - For Architecture/Dev teams
  - Quick Guide (🚨 BLOCKERS / ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY / 📋 INFO ONLY)

  - Testability concerns and gaps
  - NFR thresholds, unknowns, and planned evidence
  - Mitigation plans
- `test-design-qa.md` - For QA team
  - Test execution recipe
  - Coverage plan (P0/P1/P2/P3 with checkboxes)
  - Sprint 0 setup requirements
  - NFR test coverage and evidence plan

**Epic-Level (ONE Document):**

  - Risk assessment (probability × impact scores)
  - Test priorities (P0-P3)
  - Coverage strategy
  - NFR planning when NFRs are in scope
  - Mitigation plans

**Why Two Documents for System-Level?**

- Architecture teams scan blockers in <5 min
- QA teams have actionable test recipes
- No redundancy (cross-references instead)
- Clear separation (what to deliver vs how to test)

**Browser Automation (CLI/MCP):** Exploratory mode (live browser UI discovery)

**How-To Guide:** [Run Test Design](/docs/how-to/workflows/run-test-design.md)

- Performance: 15%

**How-To Guide:** [Run Test Review](/docs/how-to/workflows/run-test-review.md)

## nfr-assess

**Purpose:** Audit implemented NFR evidence against defined thresholds

**Phase:** Release Gate; optional earlier evidence audit when implementation evidence exists

**Frequency:** Per release (enterprise projects)

**Key Inputs:**

- NFR categories (Security, Performance, Reliability, Maintainability)
- Thresholds from PRD, architecture, or `test-design`

## trace

**Purpose:** Coverage traceability + quality gate decision

**Phase:** Phase 2/4 (traceability), Release Gate (decision)

**Frequency:** Baseline, per epic refresh, release gate

**Two-Phase Workflow:**

**Phase 1: Coverage Traceability**

- Coverage oracle items → test mapping
- Coverage classification (FULL/PARTIAL/NONE)
- Gap prioritization
- Output: `traceability-matrix.md`

**Phase 2: Gate Decision**

- PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL/WAIVED decision
- Evidence-based (coverage %, quality scores, NFRs)
- Output: `gate-decision-{gate_type}-{story_id}.md`

**Gate Rules:**

- P0 coverage: 100% required
- P1 coverage: ≥90% for PASS, 80-89% for CONCERNS, <80% FAIL
- Overall coverage: ≥80% required

**How-To Guide:** [Run Trace](/docs/how-to/workflows/run-trace.md)

---

## GATE (Agent Menu Shortcut)

**Purpose:** Release gate routing helper — not a standalone workflow; produces no artifact of its own.

**Trigger:** Type `GATE` in chat after loading the TEA agent (`bmad-tea`).

**What it does:** Determines which release gate evidence exists and guides you through the correct sequence:

1. (Optional) `test-review` — final test quality audit
2. (Optional) `nfr-assess` — NFR Evidence Audit
3. `trace` Phase 2 — PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL/WAIVED gate decision

The agent asks which evidence is available and routes to the right workflow. It does not merge these workflows; each workflow is invoked separately in sequence.

**When to use:** When you are approaching a release and want a single starting point that covers all release gate checks without needing to know which workflow to invoke first.
