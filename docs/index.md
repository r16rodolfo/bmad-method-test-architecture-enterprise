# Test Architect (TEA)

## What is TEA?

TEA (Test Engineering Architect) is a BMAD module for testing strategy and automation. It provides nine workflows covering learning, setup, design, automation, review, and release gates.

- **Workflow‑Driven**: Multiple workflows covering covering day to day activities of a test architect.
- **Consistent Outputs**: Knowledge-base guidance keeps standards consistent, no matter the agent being used.
- **Risk‑Based**: P0–P3 prioritization from probability × impact.
- **Release Gates**: Evidence‑backed go/no‑go decisions with traceability.

## Quick Install

```bash
npx bmad-method install
# Select: Test Architect (TEA)
```

Then trigger workflows via chat:

```
bmad-tea    # Load TEA agent/menu
test-design # Run Test Design workflow
```

## Getting Started

Pick a path:

- **New to Testing?** Start with [TEA Academy](/tutorials/learn-testing-tea-academy) - Learn testing from fundamentals to advanced practices (7 sessions, 1-2 weeks)
- **TEA Lite**: Start with [Test Automation](/how-to/workflows/run-automate) only (30 minutes)
- **Full TEA**: Start with the [TEA Overview](/explanation/tea-overview) for the complete workflow map
- **Enterprise**: Choose [Greenfield](/how-to/brownfield/use-tea-for-enterprise) or [Brownfield](/how-to/brownfield/use-tea-with-existing-tests)
- **Custom Extensions**: See [Extend TEA with Custom Workflows](/how-to/customization/extend-tea-with-custom-workflows)

## Core Workflows

| Workflow                                                  | Trigger | Purpose                               |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------- |
| [Teach Me Testing](/how-to/workflows/teach-me-testing)    | TMT     | Learn testing (7 sessions, 1-2 weeks) |
| [Test Design](/how-to/workflows/run-test-design)          | TD      | Risk-based planning + NFR planning    |
| [Framework Setup](/how-to/workflows/setup-test-framework) | TF      | Scaffold test framework               |
| [CI/CD Integration](/how-to/workflows/setup-ci)           | CI      | Set up quality pipeline               |
| [ATDD](/how-to/workflows/run-atdd)                        | AT      | Failing acceptance tests (TDD)        |
| [Test Automation](/how-to/workflows/run-automate)         | TA      | Expand automation coverage            |
| [Test Review](/how-to/workflows/run-test-review)          | RV      | Quality audit with scoring            |
| [NFR Evidence Audit](/how-to/workflows/run-nfr-assess)    | NR      | Non-functional evidence evaluation    |
| [Requirements Tracing](/how-to/workflows/run-trace)       | TR      | Coverage mapping + gate decision      |

> **Agent menu shortcut:** The TEA agent menu also provides a `GATE` intent (trigger: `GATE` in chat after loading `bmad-tea`). It is a routing helper — not a standalone workflow — that guides you through the release gate sequence: optional test-review → optional nfr-assess → trace Phase 2 gate decision. It produces no artifact of its own.
