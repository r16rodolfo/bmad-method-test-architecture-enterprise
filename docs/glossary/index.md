| **Risk-Based Testing**       | Testing approach where depth scales with business impact using probability × impact scoring (1-9 scale).                                                                                                                     |
| **System-Level Test Design** | Test planning at architecture level (Phase 3) focusing on testability review, ADR mapping, and test infrastructure needs.                                                                                                    |
| **tea-index.csv**            | Manifest file tracking all knowledge fragments, their descriptions, tags, and which workflows load them.                                                                                                                     |
| **TEA Integrated**           | Full BMad Method integration with TEA workflows across all phases (Phase 2, 3, 4, and Release Gate).                                                                                                                         |
| **TEA Lite**                 | Beginner approach using just `automate` to test existing features (simplest way to use TEA).                                                                                                                                 |
| **TEA Solo**                 | Standalone engagement model using TEA without full BMad Method integration (bring your own requirements).                                                                                                                    |
| **Test Priorities**          | Classification system for test importance: P0 (critical path), P1 (high value), P2 (medium value), P3 (low value).                                                                                                           |
